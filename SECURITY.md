## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Publicly Disclose

Please do not create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

### 2. Report Privately

Send your report to: **security@echograph.io**

Or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
1. Go to the Security tab
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the form with details

### 3. Include in Your Report

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 4. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 7-30 days
  - Medium: 30-90 days
  - Low: Next release

### 5. Disclosure Process

1. You report the vulnerability privately
2. We confirm receipt and begin investigation
3. We develop and test a fix
4. We release a security patch
5. We coordinate public disclosure with you
6. We credit you in the security advisory (if desired)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Production Deployment

1. **Change Default Passwords**
   ```env
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<strong-random-password>
   API_SECRET_KEY=<strong-random-secret>
   MINIO_SECRET_KEY=<strong-random-secret>
   ```

2. **Enable HTTPS**
   - Use SSL/TLS certificates
   - Configure HTTPS in production
   - Update CORS settings

3. **Secure Database**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable SSL connections
   - Regular backups
   - Restrict network access

4. **Configure Firewall**
   - Only expose necessary ports
   - Use VPC/private networks
   - Implement rate limiting

5. **Update Regularly**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Monitor security advisories

6. **Enable Logging**
   - Configure audit logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activity
   - Set up alerts

#### Environment Variables

Never commit these to version control:
- `API_SECRET_KEY`
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `MINIO_SECRET_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Any other credentials

#### Access Control

1. **User Roles**
   - Assign minimum necessary permissions
   - Regularly review access
   - Disable inactive accounts

2. **API Keys**
   - Rotate regularly
   - Use separate keys per environment
   - Revoke compromised keys immediately

3. **File Upload**
   - Validate file types
   - Scan for malware
   - Limit file sizes
   - Use separate storage for uploads

### For Developers

#### Code Security

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use Pydantic schemas
   - Sanitize file uploads

2. **SQL Injection**
   - Use SQLAlchemy ORM
   - Never construct raw SQL from user input
   - Use parameterized queries

3. **XSS Prevention**
   - Escape user-generated content
   - Use Content Security Policy
   - Validate and sanitize inputs

4. **Authentication**
   - Use strong password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Implement JWT properly
   - Set appropriate token expiration
   - Never store passwords in plain text

5. **Dependencies**
   - Run `npm audit` and `pip audit` regularly
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Review security advisories

#### Testing

1. **Security Tests**
   - Test authentication flows
   - Test authorization boundaries
   - Test input validation
   - Test for common vulnerabilities

2. **Code Review**
   - Review security-sensitive changes
   - Look for common vulnerabilities
   - Follow secure coding guidelines

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **File Upload**
   - Basic file type validation
   - No built-in malware scanning
   - **Recommendation**: Integrate antivirus scanning

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Basic rate limiting implemented
   - May need adjustment for production
   - **Recommendation**: Use API gateway

3. **Encryption**
   - Data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
   - Database encryption not enabled by default
   - **Recommendation**: Enable database encryption

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Basic logging implemented
   - Not all actions logged by default
   - **Recommendation**: Implement comprehensive audit logs

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Token expiration

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Resource-level permissions
   - Admin/Reviewer/User roles

3. **Data Protection**
   - HTTPS/WSS support
   - CORS configuration
   - SQL injection prevention (ORM)
   - XSS protection

4. **File Security**
   - File type validation
   - Size limits
   - Isolated storage

5. **API Security**
   - Request validation
   - Rate limiting
   - Error handling (no sensitive info in errors)

## Compliance

EchoGraph can be configured to help meet various compliance requirements:

- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy
- **SOC 2**: Security controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data (with additional configuration)

*Note: Compliance is shared responsibility. You must configure and operate EchoGraph according to your compliance requirements.*
